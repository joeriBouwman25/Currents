          It's always around me, all this noise, but Not nearly as loud as the
          voice saying "Let it happen, let it happen" (It's gonna feel so good)
          "Just let it happen, let it happen"
        </p>
        <p>
          All this running around Tryin' to cover my shadow A notion growing
          inside Now all the others seem shallow All this running around Bearing
          down on my shoulders I can hear an alarm It must be morning
        </p>
        <p>
          I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round It's gonna carry off
          all that isn't bound, and When it happens, when it happens (I won't be
          holding on) So let it happen, let it happen
        </p>
        <p>
          All this running around I can't fight it much longer Something's
          tryin' to get out And it's never been closer If my take-off fails Make
          up some other story But if I never come back Tell my mother I'm sorry
        </p>
        <p>
          Baby, now I'm ready, moving on Oh, but maybe I was ready all along Oh,
          I'm ready for the moment and the sound Oh, but maybe I was ready all
          along Baby, now I'm ready, moving on Oh, but maybe I was ready all
          along Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound Oh, but maybe I was
          ready all along

            In the end, it's stronger than I know how to be And I can't just
            spend my whole lifetime wondering I fell in love with the sound of
            my heels on the wooden floor I don't want our footsteps to be silent
            anymore

          <p>I'll only know in the moment Anticipation growing</p>

          I was raging, it was late In the world my demons cultivate I felt the
          strangest emotion but it wasn't hate for once Yes, I'm changing, yes,
          I'm gone Yes, I'm older, yes, I'm moving on And if you don't think
          it's a crime, you can come along with me Life is moving, can't you see
          There's no future left for you and me I was hoping and I was searching
          endlessly But baby, now there's nothing left that I can do
        </p>
        <p>So don't be blue There is another future Waiting there for you</p>
        <p>
          I saw it different, I must admit I caught a glimpse, I'm going after
          it They say people never change but that's bullshit, they do Yes, I'm
          changing, can't stop it now And even if I wanted I wouldn't know how
          Another version of myself I think I've found at last And I can't
          always hide away Curse indulgence and despise the fame There is a
          world out there and it's calling my name And it's calling yours, girl
        </p>

          Someone said they left together I ran out the door to get her She was
          holding hands with Trevor Not the greatest feeling ever Said, "Pull
          yourself together You should try your luck with Heather" Then I heard
          they slept together Oh, the less I know the better The less I know the
          better
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side? No surprise when
          you're on his shoulder like every night Oh, my love, can't you see
          that you're on my mind? Don't suppose we could convince your lover to
          change his mind? So goodbye
        </p>
        <p>
          She said, "It's not now or never Wait ten years, we'll be together" I
          said, "Better late than never Just don't make me wait forever" Don't
          make me wait forever Don't make me wait forever
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side? I don't suppose you
          could convince your lover to change his mind?
        </p>
        <p>
          I was doing fine without ya Till I saw your face, now I can't erase
          Giving in to all his bullshit Is this what you want? Is this who you
          are? I was doing fine without ya Till I saw your eyes turn away from
          mine Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you
        </p>
        <p>
          Said, "Come on, Superman, say your stupid line" Said, "Come on,
          Superman, say your stupid line" Said, "Come on, Superman, say your
          stupid line"

        <p>
          I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners Which is standard for
          me, Thursday, 12:30 I've got a pretty solid routine these days I don't
          know, it just works for me Anyway, I was leaving, I was getting in my
          car And I went to adjust the rear-view mirror But, in its reflection,
          just for a second I saw a figure, started to trigger Memories flooded
          back, stopped me in my tracks Who was that? It was my lover A lover
          from a past life
        </p>
        <p>
          From a past life Feel like I saw a ghost From a past life So
          unexpected From a past life I was transfixed From a past life
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, somewhere between a lover and a friend It was different back
          then Surreal, poetic but uncertain Like a bizarre chick-flick with a
          confusing end But I shut it down, closed it off The sounds and smells
          I made myself forget A cheap solution to block out regret, but it was
          real It just feels like a past life
        </p>
        <p>
          From a past life Crazy From a past life It takes a lot to trip me out
          (I always wondered if you wanted my love) For the first time In a long
          time (I always wondered if you wanted my love)
        </p>
        <p>
          So I go about my day as normal But I can't seem to pass it off as just
          a random event It consumes me I thought I was moving on, but I guess I
          was just switching off And now I see my life as the banal slog it
          instantly became And I don't know if I can go on the same But I don't
          wanna dig up old bones I mean, I don't even know if she has the same
          phone number Who knows? Maybe she does
        </p>
        <p>
          From a past life I guess there's no harm in trying From a past life
          What's the worst that could happen? (I always wondered if you wanted
          my love) For the first time In a long time (I tried to say it but it
          never came out right) Past life From a past life (You're not a
          stranger if you're always on my mind) For the first time (I know it's
          late, it just didn't feel right) In a long time
        </p>

          Like the brutal morning sun It dawns on me, what have I done? Saying
          sorry ain't as good as saying why But it buys me a little more time
          Lost in the moment for the second time Each fuck up that I make, it
          makes you cry I'm as pathetic, as the reason why In desperation, all
          that you can do is ask me why
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Cause I'm a man, woman Don't always think before I do ‘Cause I'm a

          man, woman Not often proud of what I choose I'm a human, woman A
          greater force I answer to

        <p>
          Once again, as it takes a hold I am aware I'm not in control You see,
          I have a conscience and it's never fooled But it's prone to be
          overruled You wanna know why I always think I’m right? (Why?) You
          never accept defeat and let it slide (Why?) I have no voice if I don’t
          speak my mind (Why?) My weakness is the source of all my pride I'll
          tell you why

          ‘Cause I'm a man, woman Don't always think before I do ‘Cause I'm a

          fading Heading for the deep end Soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
          I just need to breathe out Decisions are approaching, reality in
          motion

          Trying to be patient but I'm feeling ancient Trying to control the way
          that I'm facing Suppose that I didn't care anymore Fate can decide, I
          can ignore I'll just pretend that I always knew That I had the chance
          to
        </p>
        <p>
          There's no one else around you Not that I was waiting, vision ever
          fading Making such a promise Only leads to heartache, closer to an
          earthquake Talked about in Hollywood Trying to stay in motion
        </p>
        <p>
          It made my heart run in circles and overflow And I was closer than
          ever to letting go It made my heart run in circles and overdrive And I
          was closer than ever to feeling alive It made my heart run in circles
          and overflow And I was closer than ever to letting go It made my heart
          run in circles and overdrive And I was closer than ever to feeling
          alive

          Let's not think about it Put your arms around me, I can sense you
          doubt me You don't need to promise That only leads to heartache,
          closer to an earthquake Talked about in Hollywood All there's left to
          do, all there's left to do All there's left to do, all there's left to

          I may not be as honest as I ought to be Now that, when the walls go up
          I said it didn't worry me but it hit me like an arrow Babe, to know, I
          could just be paranoid Won't quell the desire to know what was really
          going on "Does it really fucking matter, babe?" is all you can ask me
          Okay, fair play, here we go
        </p>
        <p>
          I've heard those words before Are you sure it was nothing Cause it
          made me feel like dying inside Never thought I was insecure, but it's
          pure Didn't notice until I was in love for real Am I really gonna
          cross the line Just to find what you're typing? If only I could read
          your mind Ooh, I'd be fine, I'd be normal Now’s my time, gonna do it
        </p>
        <p>
          And suddenly I'm the phony one The only one with a problem True love
          is bringing it out of me The worst in me, and I know now Do you
          remember the time we were The time we were by the ocean? I didn't care
          if it was day or night The world was right where I wanted Girl, I'm
          sorry Babe, I'm really, really sorry

          I can just hear them now "How could you let us down?" But they don't
          know what I found Or see it from this way 'round Feeling it overtake
          All that I used to hate One by one, every trait I tried, but it's way
          too late All the signs I don't read Two sides of me can't agree Will I
          be in too deep? Going with what I always longed for
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel like a brand new person (But you'll make the same old mistakes) I
          don't care, I'm in love (Stop before it's too late) (I know) Feel like
          a brand new person (But you'll make the same old mistakes) I finally
          know what it's like (You don't have what it takes) (Stop before it's
          too late) (I know there's too much at stake) (Making the same
          mistakes) And I still don't know why it's happening (Stop while it's
          not too late) And I still don't know
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally taking flight I know you don't think it's right I know that
          you think it's fake Maybe fake's what I like The point is, I have the
          right Not thinking in black and white I'm thinking it's worth the
          fight Soon to be out of sight Knowing it all this time Going with what
          I always longed for
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel like a brand new person (But you'll make the same old mistakes) I
          don't care, I'm in love (Stop before it's too late) Feel like a brand
          new person (But you'll make the same old mistakes) So how do I know
          I've gone too far? (You don't have what it takes) (Stop before it's
          too late)
        </p>
        <p>
          Man, I know that it's hard to digest But maybe your story ain't so
          different from the rest And I know it seems wrong to accept But you've
          got your demons, and she's got her regrets And I know that it's hard
          to digest A realisation is as good as a guess And I know it seems
          wrong to accept But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
          But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel like a brand new person So, how will I know that it's right? In a
          new direction So, how will I know I've gone too far? (Stop thinking
          that the only option was) Feel like a brand new person I finally know
          what it's like (Stop thinking that the only option was) In a new
          direction So how will I know I've gone too far? (Stop thinking that
          the only option was) And I know it's hard to describe (Stop thinking
          that the only option was) So how will I know that it's right?
